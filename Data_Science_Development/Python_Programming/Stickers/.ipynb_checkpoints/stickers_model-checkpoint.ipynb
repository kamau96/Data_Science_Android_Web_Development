    "Linear (and not quite) models on time series\n",
    "Often, in my job, I have to build models with fast, good, cheap as my only guiding principle. That means that some of these models will never be considered \"production ready\" as they demand too much time for data preparation (as in SARIMA) or require frequent re-training on new data (again, SARIMA) or are difficult to tune (good example - SARIMA). Therefore, it's very often much easier to select a few features from the existing time series and build a simple linear regression model or, say, a random forest. It is good and cheap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is not backed by theory and breaks several assumptions (e.g. Gauss-Markov theorem, especially for errors being uncorrelated), but it is very useful in practice and is often used in machine learning competitions.\n",

    " steps back, we get a feature column where the current value of time series is aligned with its value at time t−n\n",
    ". If we make a 1 lag shift and train a model on that feature, the model will be able to forecast 1 step ahead from having observed the current state of the series. Increasing the lag, say, up to 6, will allow the model to make predictions 6 steps ahead; however it will use data observed 6 steps back. If something fundamentally changes the series during that unobserved period, the model will not catch these changes and will return forecasts with a large error. Therefore, during the initial lag selection, one has to find a balance between the optimal prediction quality and the length of the forecasting horizon.\n",

In our example, every day of the week and every hour of the day can be encoded by the corresponding average number of ads watched during that day or hour.

    "As we already know, not all features are equally healthy -- some may lead to overfitting while others should be removed. Besides manual inspection, we can apply regularization. Two of the most popular regression models with regularization are Ridge and Lasso regressions. They both add some more constrains to our loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Ridge regression, those constraints are the sum of squares of the coefficients multiplied by the regularization coefficient. The bigger the coefficient a feature has, the bigger our loss will be. Hence, we will try to optimize the model while keeping the coefficients fairly low.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this L2\n",
    " regularization, we will have higher bias and lower variance, so the model will generalize better (at least that's what we hope will happen).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second regression model, Lasso regression, adds to the loss function, not squares, but absolute values of the coefficients. As a result, during the optimization process, coefficients of unimportant features may become zeroes, which allows for automated feature selection. This regularization type is called L1\n",

    "But, this victory is decieving, and it might not be the brightest idea to fit xgboost as soon as you get your hands on time series data. Generally, tree-based models handle trends in data poorly when compared with linear models. In that case, you would have to detrend your series first or use some tricks to make the magic happen. Ideally, you can make the series stationary and then use XGBoost. For example, you can forecast trend separately with a linear model and then add predictions from xgboost to get a final forecast.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "We discussed different time series analysis and prediction methods. Unfortunately, or maybe luckily, there is no one way to solve these kind of problems. Methods developed in the 1960s (and some even in the beginning of the 21st century) are still popular, along with LSTMs and RNNs (not covered in this article). This is partially related to the fact that the prediction task, like any other data-related task, requires creativity in so many aspects and definitely requires research. In spite of the large number of formal quality metrics and approaches to parameters estimation, it is often necessary to try something different for each time series. Last but not least, the balance between quality and cost is important. As a good example, the SARIMA model can produce spectacular results after tuning but can require many hours of tambourine dancing time series manipulation while a simple linear regression model can be built in 10 minutes and can achieve more or less comparable results.\n",
